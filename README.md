# Task Description

The task involves building an ensemble of multiple NLP models using the provided dataset, "Problem_Dataset.xlsx". The goal is to label sentences with criteria A1, A2, etc. This involves multiple subtasks ranging from building individual deep learning models for binary classification to using BERT models and comparing their performance.

## **Implementation Notes**

-   The Jupyter Notebook **`main.ipynb`** contains clean Python code for each subtask with detailed explanations and comments for code readability.

-   External modules and dependencies used are listed in the **`requirements.txt`** file for reproducibility in Google Colab.

## **Assumptions and Decisions**

-   Assumed binary classification for each label.

-   Chose deep learning-based models for subtask 1, and modified versions for subtask 2 and 3 due to their effectiveness in NLP tasks.

-   Used BERT model but got some errors in task 3.
